CICD using FastAPI, Docker, Terraform, Gitlab pipelines, and AWS (EC2 & RDS)

The goal of this project is to set up a reusabe API backend that can be spun up with ease through terraform onto AWS.

## Installation

Use the package manager [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install foobar.

```bash
cd services/talk_booking/
poetry intstall
```

Set up a Gitlab Repo (note: if you want to use Github, you can setup a Gitlab repo to mirror it and still get all the benefits of the Pipeline)

## Things that need to change
